# --- Booking Target & Timing ---
# Date of the pass you want to book (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
TARGET_DATE=2024-06-18
# Whether to use scheduling (true/false).
# If true, the script will wait for the release time for TARGET_DATE before making any booking attempts.
# If false, the script will attempt to book immediately ONLY IF the date is already available on the site (for development/testing only!).
# WARNING: Do not use SCHEDULE=false for real bookings. This may result in unnecessary requests and is only for workflow testing.
SCHEDULE=true
# Time to switch from slow polling (every 1s) to fast polling (every 0.05s) before START_TIME (24-hour format, e.g., 06:59)
# Only used if SCHEDULE=true
SLOW_POLL_UNTIL=06:59
# Time to start the booking flow (24-hour format, e.g., 07:00)

VEHICLE_KEYWORD=Tesla

# --- Pass Type Selection ---
# Enable the pass type matrix below. The bot will attempt to book passes in the following priority order:
# 1. If CHECK_ALL_DAY is true, it will try to book an All Day Pass first.
# 2. If CHECK_ALL_DAY is true but the All Day Pass is not available, and either CHECK_MORNING or CHECK_AFTERNOON is also true, it will fall back to try for half-day passes.
# 3. If both half-day passes are enabled, the bot will try Afternoon first, then Morning.
# 4. If only one of the half-day passes is enabled, only that pass will be attempted.
# 5. If CHECK_ALL_DAY is false, it will only try for the enabled half-day passes (Afternoon first if both are enabled).
# This allows you to control fallback and priority by toggling these options.
#
# Example: CHECK_ALL_DAY=true, CHECK_MORNING=true, CHECK_AFTERNOON=true will try all-day, then afternoon, then morning.
# Example: CHECK_ALL_DAY=false, CHECK_MORNING=true, CHECK_AFTERNOON=true will try afternoon, then morning.
# Example: CHECK_ALL_DAY=false, CHECK_MORNING=true, CHECK_AFTERNOON=false will only try for the morning pass.

# Whether to check for All Day Pass (true/false)
CHECK_ALL_DAY=true
# Whether to check for Morning Pass (true/false)
CHECK_MORNING=false
# Whether to check for Afternoon Pass (true/false)
CHECK_AFTERNOON=false

# NOTE: The bot will exit if the target date is more than 3 days away from today, or if the date is not present on the booking page.
